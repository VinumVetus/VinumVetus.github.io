This page introduces a selection of currently available artificial intelligence tools and explains what they are designed to do. It focuses on how these tools are used in real-world situations, including everyday tasks, creative work, and technical or professional applications.
Modern AI tools are specialized for different tasks rather than serving a single universal purpose. ChatGPT and Claude focus on general reasoning and writing, with ChatGPT emphasizing versatility and interaction while Claude excels at long documents and structured analysis. Gemini is tightly integrated with Google’s ecosystem and is strongest when working with search, documents, and multimodal input. Perplexity functions as a research-oriented AI, prioritizing factual answers supported by cited sources. Cursor and GitHub Copilot are development-focused tools, embedding AI directly into coding workflows to assist with writing, refactoring, and debugging code. Midjourney, DALL·E, and Stable Diffusion specialize in image generation, differing mainly in artistic style, control, and openness. Runway targets video creation and editing, while ElevenLabs focuses on realistic voice synthesis. Grok is designed for real-time social and trend-driven analysis using live online data. These differences in training data, integration, and design explain why each AI tool is effective in specific contexts but limited outside its intended role.
